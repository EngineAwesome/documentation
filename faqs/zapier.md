### I see two ID fields when creating a Zap. Does it matter which one I choose?

You can use either 'ID' field. 

### When creating a Zap, why donâ€™t I see all my Engine Awesome fields available for use. 

Only fields marked "is searchable" in your Engine Awesome schema are available in Zapier. 

To add your field to Zapier, edit the field in Engine Awesome, save, and refresh the feed in Zapier. The field should now be available.
