### Why is the "Go to New Object" button in my layout disabled?

The "Go to New Object" button creates a new object, by going to your default object layout. If the button is disabled, it means you don't have a default layout set. 
To resolve:
- Create a new layout for that object.
- In the Layout settings, mark the "Type" as "Item", and make sure the "Default Layout" toggle is on. 
- You should be all set!
