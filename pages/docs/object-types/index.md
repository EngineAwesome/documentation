## 1. Add Object Types
From your Team Settings page, scroll down to the "Add Object Type" area, and simply type in the name you want to use, in it's plural form. Some examples are: contacts, projects, jobs, stores, etc. 

Congratulations! You just created your first Object Type.

Your Object Type is now listed in the "Object Types" area, and it's time to configure it. 

## 2. Configure
When you configure your Object Type, you are essentially setting it up work the way you want. You add fields and define relationships with other Object Types.

Let's get started! In the "Object Types" area, click "Edit Object Type" for the object you want to configure. You should now be on the "Edit Object" screen.

## 3. Fields
Fields allow you to store data within an Object Type. With Engine Awesome, you choose the kind of data you want to store, the field type and the name. Everything is exactly the way you want it. 

The order in which you define your fields doesn't matter. To get started, click the big blue + at the top of the screen to open the field library. Simply, double-click on the a field type to place it on the canvas, or drag it over.

Engine Awesome has a ton of field types to choose from:

### Text
A simple one-line text field. 

### Name
Used to store the name of a person, animal, etc. If you want to store a person's first and last name, you would use this field twice.

### Phone Number
Store a phone number from any country. *[Smart Field](#smart-fields)*
