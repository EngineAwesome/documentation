Welcome to Engine Awesome! This guide covers everything you need to know about building applications in Engine Awesome.


## What is Engine Awesome?

With Engine Awesome, you can build powerful, custom applications to support your business or teamâ€™s most important workflows.

Some examples are a content management system(CRM), quoting/invoicing system, project management tool or all of the above!  Engine Awesome is flexible enough to handle workflows of all sizes, and grow with your business or team.


You can build a custom application in just three simple steps:

## 1. Create an Object Type
Object Types allow you to group similar data together. Common examples are "Contacts", "Projects" and "Invoices".

In Engine Awesome, creating an Object Type is as simple and going to your Team settings page, filling in the "Add Object Type" field and pressing "add".

Engine Awesome can handle as many Object Types as you like.

## 2. Define your Objects
Once you've created an Object Type, you will need to define it, adding all the fields you want to use with this Object, and any Object relationships you want it to have.

For example, you may have two Object Types, "Companies" and "Contacts". For the "Contact" Object, you can add fields like "First Name" and "Last Name". Then you can create a relationship between "Contacts" and "Companies".

The Object can be as extensive as you like. Additionally, you can add to it as you business grows and your needs change.

## 3. Create a Layout
Now you get to take all those fields and relationships you defined in your schema and create Layouts with them. Layouts can be forms or list tables or a combination of both. Both individual fields and full Layouts can be conditionally shown based on other field values.

Layouts are incredibly powerful, and there's no limit to how many you can have for each Object Type.
