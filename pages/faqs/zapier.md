### I see two ID fields when creating a Zap. Does it matter which one I choose?

You can use either 'ID' field. 

### When creating a Zap, why donâ€™t I see all my Engine Awesome fields available for use. 

Only fields marked "Is Searchable" in your Engine Awesome schema are available in Zapier. 

To add your field to Zapier:
1. Go to your objects schema in Engine Awesome.
2. Edit the field you want to use in Zapier.
3. In the right column in field settings check the box marked "Is Searchable", and save.
4. Refresh the feed in Zapier, and the field should now be available.
